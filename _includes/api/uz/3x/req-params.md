<h3 id='req.params'>req.params</h3>

This property is an array containing properties mapped to the named route "parameters".
For example if you have the route `/user/:name`, then the "name" property
is available to you as `req.params.name`. This object defaults to `{}`.

~~~js
// GET /user/tj
req.params.name
// => "tj"
~~~

When a regular expression is used for the route definition, capture groups
are provided in the array using `req.params[N]`, where `N`
is the nth capture group. This rule is applied to unnamed wild-card matches
with string routes such as `/file/*`:

~~~js
// GET /file/javascripts/jquery.js
req.params[0]
// => "javascripts/jquery.js"
~~~
