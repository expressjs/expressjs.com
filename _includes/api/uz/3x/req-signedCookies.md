<h3 id='req.signedCookies'>req.signedCookies</h3>

This object requires the `cookieParser(secret)` middleware for use. 
It contains signed cookies sent by the user-agent, unsigned and ready for use. 
Signed cookies reside in a different object to show developer intent; otherwise, 
a malicious attack could be placed on `req.cookie` values (which are easy to spoof). 
Note that signing a cookie does not make it "hidden" or encrypted; this simply 
prevents tampering (because the secret used to sign is private). If no signed 
cookies are sent, it defaults to `{}`.

// Cookie: user=tobi.CP7AWaXDfAKIRfH49dQzKJx7sKzzSoPq7/AcBBRVwlI3
req.signedCookies.user
// => "tobi"
