<h3 id='app.put.method'>app.put(path, callback [, callback ...])</h3>

Routes HTTP PUT requests to the specified path with the specified callback functions.
For more information, see the [routing guide](/guide/routing.html).

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave just like middleware,
except that these callbacks can invoke `next('route')` to bypass the
remaining route callback(s). You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on
a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there's no reason to proceed with
the current route.

~~~js
app.put('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('PUT request to homepage');
});
