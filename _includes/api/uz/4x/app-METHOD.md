<h3 id='app.METHOD'>app.METHOD(path, callback [, callback ...])</h3>

Routes an HTTP request, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request, such as GET,
PUT, POST, and so on, in lowercase. Thus, the actual methods are `app.get()`,
`app.post()`, `app.put()`, and so on.  See below for the complete list.

For more information, see the [routing guide](/guide/routing.html).

Express supports the following routing methods corresponding to the HTTP methods of the same names:

  To route methods which translate to invalid JavaScript variable names, use the bracket notation. For example, 
  `app['m-search']('/', function ...`.
</div>

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave just like middleware, except
that these callbacks can invoke `next('route')` to bypass
the remaining route callback(s). You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions
on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there is no reason to proceed with the current route.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
  The API documentation has explicit entries only for the most popular HTTP methods `app.get()`,
  `app.post()`, `app.put()`, and `app.delete()`.
  However, the other methods listed above work in exactly the same way.
</div>

There is a special routing method, `app.all()`, that is not derived from any HTTP method.
It loads middleware at a path for all request methods.

In the following example, the handler is executed for requests to "/secret" whether using
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method.

~~~js
app.all('/secret', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...')
  next() // pass control to the next handler
})
~~~
