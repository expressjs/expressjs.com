<h3 id='bodyParser'>bodyParser()</h3>

Request body parsing middleware supporting JSON, urlencoded,
and multipart requests. This middleware is simply a wrapper
for the `json()`, `urlencoded()`, and
`multipart()` middleware.

```js
app.use(express.bodyParser());

// is equivalent to:
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded());
app.use(express.multipart());
```

For security sake, it's better to disable file upload if your application
doesn't need it. To do this, use only the needed middleware, i.e. don't use
the `bodyParser` and `multipart()` middleware:

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded());
```

If your application needs file upload you should set up
