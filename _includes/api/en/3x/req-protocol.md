<h3 id='req.protocol'>req.protocol</h3>

Return the protocol string "http" or "https"
when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy"
setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header
field will be trusted. If you're running behind
a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this
may be enabled.

```js
req.protocol
// => "http"
```
