  h3(id='req.params') req.params

  p.
    This property is an object containing properties mapped to the named route "parameters".
    For example, if you have the route <code>/user/:name</code>, then the "name" property
    is available to you as <code>req.params.name</code>. This object defaults to <code>{}</code>.

  +js.
    // GET /user/tj
    req.params.name
    // => "tj"

  p.
    When a regular expression is used for the route definition, capture groups
    are provided in the array using <code>req.params[N]</code>, where <code>N</code>
    is the nth capture group. This rule is applied to unnamed wild-card matches
    with string routes such as `/file/*`:

  +js.
    // GET /file/javascripts/jquery.js
    req.params[0]
    // => "javascripts/jquery.js"
