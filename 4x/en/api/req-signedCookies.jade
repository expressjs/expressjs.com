  h3(id='req.signedCookies') req.signedCookies

  p.
    When the <code>cookieParser(secret)</code> middleware is used, this object
    defaults to <code>{}</code>. Otherwise, it contains the signed cookies sent by
    the user-agent, unsigned and ready for use. Signed cookies reside in a different
    object to show developer intent; otherwise, a malicious attack could be
    placed on `req.cookie` values (which are easy to spoof). Note that signing
    a cookie does not make it "hidden" or encrypted; this simply prevents
    tampering (because the secret used to sign is private).

  +js.
    // Cookie: user=tobi.CP7AWaXDfAKIRfH49dQzKJx7sKzzSoPq7/AcBBRVwlI3
    req.signedCookies.user
    // => "tobi"
