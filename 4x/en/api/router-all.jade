  h3(id='app.all') app.all(path, [callback...], callback)

  p.
    This method functions just like the <code>app.VERB()</code> methods,
    except that it matches all HTTP verbs. 

  p.
    This method is extremely useful for
    mapping "global" logic for specific path prefixes or arbitrary matches.
    For example, if you placed the following route at the top of all other
    route definitions, it would require that all routes from that point on
    would require authentication, and automatically load a user. Keep in mind
    that these callbacks do not have to act as end points; <code>loadUser</code>
    can perform a task, then <code>next()</code> to continue matching subsequent
    routes.

  +js.
    app.all('*', requireAuthentication, loadUser);

  p.
    Or the equivalent:

  +js.
    app.all('*', requireAuthentication)
    app.all('*', loadUser);

  p.
    Another great example of this is white-listed "global" functionality. Here
    the example is much like before, but it only restricts paths prefixed with
    "/api":

  +js.
    app.all('/api/*', requireAuthentication);
