  h3(id='app.locals') app.locals

  p.
    Application local variables are provided to all templates
    rendered within the application. This is useful for providing
    helper functions to templates, as well as app-level data.

  +js.
    app.locals.title = 'My App';
    app.locals.strftime = require('strftime');
    app.locals.email = 'me@myapp.com';

  p.
    The <code>app.locals</code> object is a JavaScript <code>Object</code>. The
    properties added to it will be exposed as local variables within the application.

  +js.
    app.locals.title
    // => 'My App'

    app.locals.email
    // => 'me@myapp.com'

  p.
    By default Express exposes only a single app-level local variable, <code>settings</code>.

  +js.
    app.set('title', 'My App');
    // use settings.title in a view
