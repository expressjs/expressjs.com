  h3(id='req.originalUrl') req.originalUrl

  p.
    This property is much like <code>req.url</code>; however, it retains
    the original request url, allowing you to rewrite <code>req.url</code>
    freely for internal routing purposes. For example, the "mounting" feature
    of <a href="#app.use">app.use()</a> will rewrite <code>req.url</code> to
    strip the mount point.

  +js.
    // GET /search?q=something
    req.originalUrl
    // => "/search?q=something"
