## Issues

## Technical committee

The Express technical committee meets online every two weeks to discuss development and maintenance of Express, and other issues relevant to the Express project.
Each meeting is typically announced in an [expressjs/discussions issue](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/issues) with a link to the Google Hangout, which is
open to all observers.

The meetings are recorded; for a list of the recordings, see the [Express.js YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjxjAeH6TRik9Iwy5nXw7g).

in the repository covering everything from API design and authentication to template engine integration.

## Other modules

Our vibrant community has created a large variety of extensions,
[middleware modules](/{{ page.lang }}/resources/middleware.html) and
[higher-level frameworks](frameworks.html).  

Additionally, the Express community maintains modules in these two GitHub orgs:

- [jshttp](https://jshttp.github.io/) modules providing useful utility functions; see [Utility modules](/{{ page.lang }}/resources/utils.html).
- [pillarjs](https://pillarjs.github.io/): low-level modules that Express uses internally.
