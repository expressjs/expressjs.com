  p.
    When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse
    the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list
    and return an array, otherwise an empty
    array is returned.
    
    For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2"
    you would receive the array <code>["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]</code>
    where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.
