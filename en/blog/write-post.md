If you have an idea for a blog post, follow these steps to propose it and potentially get it published!

1. ### Propose your post
Before taking the time to write a post, please confirm that we will be able to publish it. We're looking for topics specifically related to Express, and so we want to pre-approve all posts. For the moment, this means we aren't accepting any unsolicited posts. To propose a blog post, [open an issue](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com/issues) entitled  `Blog post proposal: <your idea>`.


1. ### Fork the repository 
If the Express TC accepts your proposal, start to write your post by forking the [expressjs.com](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com) repository and cloning it to your local machine. Once you open a pull request, you'll be able to preview your post on GitHub. See step six below.

	Optional: To run the site locally and preview your post before opening a PR, see the [setup instructions in the README](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com?tab=readme-ov-file#expressjscom).

1. ### Create a new file
Create a new file in the `_posts` directory named using following the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

1. ### Add the required front matter
    Copy the following front matter, including the dotted lines, and paste it at the top of file you just created. Replace the placeholder values with as desired.

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: <your-title>
    sub_title: <your-optional-sub-title>
    tags: <white-space-separated-topics>
    author: <your-name>
    ---
    ```
2. ### Add your content
    Finally, start writing your content below the front matter.  Use standard markdown formatting.

1. ### Open a pull request (PR)
   Once you open a PR, you will be able to preview your results: There will be a section on the page entitled `Deploy Preview for expressjscom-preview ready!` Click the link to see the site rendered from your fork/branch.
   
   You can use this feature over multiple commits to refine your post by making a `draft` pull request. Once it's ready for review, switch it to a formal PR.
