  h3(id='app.locals') app.locals

  p.
    Application local variables are provided to all templates
    rendered within the application. This is useful for providing
    helper functions to templates, as well as app-level data.

  +js.
    app.locals.title = 'My App';
    app.locals.strftime = require('strftime');

  p.
    The <code>app.locals</code> object is a JavaScript <code>Function</code>,
    which when invoked with an object will merge properties into itself, providing
    a simple way to expose existing objects as local variables.

  +js.
    app.locals({
      title: 'My App',
      phone: '1-250-858-9990',
      email: 'me@myapp.com'
    });

    app.locals.title
    // => 'My App'

    app.locals.email
    // => 'me@myapp.com'

  p.
    By default Express exposes only a single app-level local variable, <code>settings</code>.

  +js.
    app.set('title', 'My App');
    // use settings.title in a view

  p.
    <code>app.locals</code> has reserved words that should not be used.
    Avoid these words in either <code>app.locals</code>, <code>res.locals</code>, or <code>res.render</code>
    otherwise your code may not work as intended:

  ul
    li
      code name
      span  - This is due to <code>app.locals</code>'s nature as a function.
    li
      code cache
    li
      code options
    li
      code _locals
