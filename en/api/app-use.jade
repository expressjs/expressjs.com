  h3(id='app.use') app.use([path], function)
  
  p.
    Use the given middleware <code>function</code>, with optional mount <code>path</code>,
    defaulting to "/".

  +js.
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();

    // simple logger
    app.use(function(req, res, next){
      console.log('%s %s', req.method, req.url);
      next();
    });

    // respond
    app.use(function(req, res, next){
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    app.listen(3000);

  p.
    The "mount" path is stripped and is <strong>not</strong> visible
    to the middleware <code>function</code>. The main effect of this feature is that
    mounted middleware may operate without code changes regardless of its "prefix"
    pathname.

  p.
    Note that <code>use</code> declarations should usually be invoked before
    <strong>all</strong> <code>get</code> and <code>post</code> declarations.
    Otherwise they may only take effect after <code>get</code> and <code>post</code>
    declarations.

  p.
    Here's a concrete example, take the typical use-case of serving files in ./public
    using the <code>express.static()</code> middleware:

  +js.
    // GET /javascripts/jquery.js
    // GET /style.css
    // GET /favicon.ico
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

  p.
    Say for example you wanted to prefix all static files with "/static", you could
    use the "mounting" feature to support this. Mounted middleware functions are <strong>not</strong>
    invoked unless the <code>req.url</code> contains this prefix, at which point
    it is stripped when the function is invoked. This affects this function only,
    subsequent middleware will see <code>req.url</code> with "/static" included
    unless they are mounted as well.

  +js.
    // GET /static/javascripts/jquery.js
    // GET /static/style.css
    // GET /static/favicon.ico
    app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

  p.
    The order of which middleware are "defined" using <code>app.use()</code> is
    very important, they are invoked sequentially, thus this defines middleware
    precedence. For example usually <code>express.logger()</code> is the very
    first middleware you would use, logging every request:

  +js.
    app.use(express.logger());
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
    app.use(function(req, res){
      res.send('Hello');
    });

  p.
    Now suppose you wanted to ignore logging requests for static files, but to
    continue logging routes and middleware defined after <code>logger()</code>,
    you would simply move <code>static()</code> above:

  +js.
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
    app.use(express.logger());
    app.use(function(req, res){
      res.send('Hello');
    });

  p.
    Another concrete example would be serving files from multiple directories,
    giving precedence to "./public" over the others:

  +js.
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/files'));
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/uploads'));
