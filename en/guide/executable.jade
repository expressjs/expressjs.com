  h3(id='executable') Using express(1) to generate an app

  p.
    The Express team maintains a handy quickstart project generator aptly named <code>express(1)</code>. If you install express-generator globally with npm you'll have it available from anywhere on your machine:

  +js.
    $ npm install -g express-generator

  p.
    This tool provides a simple way to get an application skeleton going,
    but has limited scope, for example it supports only a few template engines,
    whereas Express itself supports virtually any template engine built for node.
    Be sure to check out the <code>--help</code>:

  +js.

    Usage: express [options]

    Options:

      -h, --help          output usage information
      -V, --version       output the version number
      -e, --ejs           add ejs engine support (defaults to jade)
      -H, --hogan         add hogan.js engine support
      -c, --css <engine>  add stylesheet <engine> support (less|stylus) (defaults to plain css)
      -f, --force         force on non-empty directory

  p.
    If you want to generate an application with Jade and Stylus
    support you would simply execute:

  +js.
    $ express --css stylus myapp

    create : myapp
    create : myapp/package.json
    create : myapp/app.js
    create : myapp/public
    create : myapp/public/javascripts
    create : myapp/public/images
    create : myapp/public/stylesheets
    create : myapp/public/stylesheets/style.styl
    create : myapp/routes
    create : myapp/routes/index.js
    create : myapp/views
    create : myapp/views/index.jade
    create : myapp/views/layout.jade

    install dependencies:
      $ cd myapp && npm install

    run the app:
      $ DEBUG=myapp node app

  p.
    Like any other node application, you must then install the dependencies:

  +js.
    $ cd myapp
    $ npm install

  p.
   Then fire it up!

  +js.
    $ node app

  p.
    That's all you need to get a simple application up and running. Keep in mind
    that Express is not bound to any specific directory structure, these are simply
    a baseline for you to work from. For application structure alternatives be
    sure to view the <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples">examples</a>
    found in the github repo.
