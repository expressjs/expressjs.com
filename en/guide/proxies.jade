  h3(id='proxies') Express behind proxies

  p.
    Using Express behind a reverse proxy (such as Varnish or Nginx)
    is trivial; however, it does require configuration. By enabling the 
    "trust proxy" setting via <code>app.enable('trust proxy')</code>, Express 
    will have knowledge that it's sitting behind a proxy and that the 
    <code>X-Forwarded-*</code> header fields may be trusted. (Otherwise, 
    they are easily spoofed.)

  p.
    Enabling this setting has several subtle effects. The first is
    that <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> may be set by the reverse proxy to
    tell the app whether it is https or simply http. This value is reflected
    by <a href="/api#req.protocol">req.protocol</a>.

  p.
    The second change is that the <a href="/api#req.ip">req.ip</a> 
    and <a href="/api#req.ips">req.ips</a> values will be populated with
    <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>'s list of addresses.
