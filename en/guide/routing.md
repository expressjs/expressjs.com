# Routing

_Routing_ refers to the definition of application end points (URIs) and how they respond to client requests.
For an introduction to routing, see [Basic routing](/{{ page.lang }}/starter/basic-routing.html).

The following code is an example of a very basic route.

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('hello world');
});
```

<h2 id="route-methods">Route methods</h2>

A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the `express` class.

The following code is an example of routes that are defined for the GET and the POST methods to the root of the app.

```js
// GET method route
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage');
});

// POST method route
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage');
});
```

Express supports the following routing methods that correspond to HTTP methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `head`, `delete`, `options`, `trace`, `copy`, `lock`, `mkcol`, `move`, `purge`, `propfind`, `proppatch`, `unlock`, `report`, `mkactivity`, `checkout`, `merge`, `m-search`, `notify`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `patch`, `search`, and `connect`.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
To route methods that translate to invalid JavaScript variable names, use the bracket notation. For example,
`app['m-search']('/', function ...`
</div>

There is a special routing method, `app.all()`, which is not derived from any HTTP method. This method is used for loading middleware functions at a path for all request methods.

In the following example, the handler will be executed for requests to "/secret" whether you are using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method that is supported in the [http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_methods).

```js
app.all('/secret', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
```

<h2 id="route-paths">Route paths</h2>

Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
  Express uses [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) for matching the route paths; see the path-to-regexp documentation for all the possibilities in defining route paths. [Express Route Tester](http://forbeslindesay.github.io/express-route-tester/) is a handy tool for testing basic Express routes, although it does not support pattern matching.
</div>

<div class="doc-box doc-warn" markdown="1">
Query strings are not part of the route path.
</div>

Here are some examples of route paths based on strings.

This route path will match requests to the root route, `/`.

```js
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('root');
});
```

This route path will match requests to `/about`.

```js
app.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('about');
});
```

This route path will match requests to `/random.text`.

```js
app.get('/random.text', function (req, res) {
  res.send('random.text');
});
```

Here are some examples of route paths based on string patterns.

This route path will match `acd` and `abcd`.

```js
app.get('/ab?cd', function(req, res) {
  res.send('ab?cd');
});
```

This route path will match `abcd`, `abbcd`, `abbbcd`, and so on.

```js
app.get('/ab+cd', function(req, res) {
  res.send('ab+cd');
});
```

This route path will match `abcd`, `abxcd`, `abRANDOMcd`, `ab123cd`, and so on.

```js
app.get('/ab*cd', function(req, res) {
  res.send('ab*cd');
});
```

This route path will match `/abe` and `/abcde`.

```js
app.get('/ab(cd)?e', function(req, res) {
 res.send('ab(cd)?e');
});
```

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
The characters ?, +, *, and () are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.
</div>

Examples of route paths based on regular expressions:

This route path will match anything with an "a" in the route name.

```js
app.get(/a/, function(req, res) {
  res.send('/a/');
});
```

This route path will match `butterfly` and `dragonfly`, but not `butterflyman`, `dragonfly man`, and so on.

```js
app.get(/.*fly$/, function(req, res) {
  res.send('/.*fly$/');
});
```

<h2 id="route-handlers">Route handlers</h2>

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like [middleware](/{{ page.lang }}/guide/using-middleware.html) to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke `next('route')` to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there's no reason to proceed with the current route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route.  For example:

```js
app.get('/example/a', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from A!');
});
```

More than one callback function can handle a route (make sure you specify the `next` object). For example:

```js
app.get('/example/b', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
  next();
}, function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from B!');
});
```

An array of callback functions can handle a route.  For example:

```js
var cb0 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
}

var cb1 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
}

var cb2 = function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from C!');
}

app.get('/example/c', [cb0, cb1, cb2]);
```

A combination of independent functions and arrays of functions can handle a route.  For example:

```js
var cb0 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
}

var cb1 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
}

app.get('/example/d', [cb0, cb1], function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
  next();
}, function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from D!');
});
```

<h2 id="response-methods">Response methods</h2>

The methods on the response object (`res`) in the following table can send a response to the client, and terminate the request-response cycle. If none of these methods are called from a route handler, the client request will be left hanging.

| Method               | Description
|----------------------|--------------------------------------
| [res.download()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.download)   | Prompt a file to be downloaded.
| [res.end()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.end)        | End the response process.
| [res.json()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.json)       | Send a JSON response.
| [res.jsonp()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.jsonp)      | Send a JSON response with JSONP support.
| [res.redirect()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.redirect)   | Redirect a request.
| [res.render()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.render)     | Render a view template.
| [res.send()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.send)       | Send a response of various types.
| [res.sendFile()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.sendFile)     | Send a file as an octet stream.
| [res.sendStatus()](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#res.sendStatus) | Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body.

<h2 id="app-route">app.route()</h2>

You can create chainable route handlers for a route path by using `app.route()`.
Because the path is specified at a single location, creating modular routes is helpful, as is reducing redundancy and typos. For more information about routes, see: [Router() documentation](/{{ page.lang }}/4x/api.html#router).

Here is an example of chained route handlers that are defined by using `app.route()`.

```js
app.route('/book')
  .get(function(req, res) {
    res.send('Get a random book');
  })
  .post(function(req, res) {
    res.send('Add a book');
  })
  .put(function(req, res) {
    res.send('Update the book');
  });
```

<h2 id="express-router">express.Router</h2>

Use the `express.Router` class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A `Router` instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a "mini-app".

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

Create a router file named `birds.js` in the app directory, with the following content:

```js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use(function timeLog(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  next();
});
// define the home page route
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Birds home page');
});
// define the about route
router.get('/about', function(req, res) {
  res.send('About birds');
});

module.exports = router;
```

Then, load the router module in the app:

```js
var birds = require('./birds');
...
app.use('/birds', birds);
```

The app will now be able to handle requests to `/birds` and `/birds/about`, as well as call the `timeLog` middleware function that is specific to the route.
