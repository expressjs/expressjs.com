## 4.14.0
{: id="4.14.0"}

<small>Release date: 2016-06-16</small>

The 4.14.0 minor release is a bunch of bug fixes, security update, performance improvements, and minor feature additions. The most salient points are listed below.

<ul>
  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  This version onwards, Express supports Node.js 6.x.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  Fixes a [Regular Expression Denial of Service in the negotiator module](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/106).
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  `res.sendFile` now accepts two new options, `acceptRanges` and `cacheControl`.

  You can use `acceptRanges`, which defauts to `true`, to enable or disable accepting ranged requests. Disabling it will not send `Accept-Ranges` and ignore the contents of the `Range` request header.

  `cacheControl`, which defaults to `true`, can be used to enable or disable setting `Cache-Control` response header. Disabling it will ignore the `maxAge` option.

  `res.sendFile` has also been updated to handle `Range` header and redirections better.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  `res.location` and `res.redirect` will now URL encode the URL, if it is not already.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  You will notice great improvement in the performance of `res.json` and `res.jsonp` in most cases.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  Apart from a number of improvements in the cookie module, it now adds a `sameSite` option to let you specify the [SameSite cookie attribute](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07).

  Note that, the `SameSite` cookie attribute is an attribute that has not yet been fully standardized, and may change in the future. This also means many clients may ignore this attribute until they understand it.

  The possible value for the `sameSite` option are:

  - `true`, which sets the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.
  - `false`, which does not set the `SameSite` attribute.
  - `'lax'`, which sets the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` for lax same site enforcement.
  - `'strict'`, which sets the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  Absolute path checking on Windows, which was incorrect for some cases, has been fixed now.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  IP address(es) resolution with proxies has been greatly improved.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1" class="changelog-item">
  The `req.range` options object now includes a `combine` option (`false` by default), which when `true`, combines overlapping and adjacent ranges and return as if they were specified that way in the header.
  </li>
</ul>
