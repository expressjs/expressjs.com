These template engines work "out-of-the-box" with Express:

- **[Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)**: Haml-inspired template engine (formerly Jade).
- **[Haml.js](https://github.com/tj/haml.js)**: Haml implementation.

- **[hbs](https://github.com/pillarjs/hbs)**: Adapter for Handlebars.js, an extension of Mustache.js template engine.
- **[Squirrelly](https://github.com/nebrelbug/squirrelly)**: Blazing-fast template engine that supports partials, helpers, custom tags, and caching. Not white-space sensitive, works with any language.
- **[React](https://github.com/reactjs/express-react-views)**: Renders React components on the server. It renders static markup and does not support mounting those views on the client.

- **[Blade](https://github.com/bminer/node-blade)**: HTML Template Compiler, inspired by Jade & Haml.
