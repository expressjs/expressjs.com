The Express.js team is pleased to announce a partnership with HeroDevs to launch [Express Never-Ending Support (NES)](https://www.herodevs.com/support/express-nes), providing long-term support for applications built with legacy Express. This collaboration ensures that developers relying on older versions of the framework will continue to receive critical security and compatibility updates, allowing them to maintain and scale their applications securely, even after the framework's official end-of-life.

Express.js is known for its minimalistic design and flexibility, offering developers a powerful yet lightweight framework for building web and mobile applications. Its extensive set of HTTP utility methods and middleware have made creating APIs both efficient and scalable—qualities that have made it a go-to choice for Node.js developers over the years.

However, Express.js v3.x reached its end-of-life in July 2015, leaving many businesses and developers in need of support to keep their applications secure and compliant. 

> "We’re grateful to see HeroDevs stepping in to provide extended long-term support for Express
>
> Express NES ensures that the many businesses and developers who rely on Express can continue using it safely and securely, even years after its original end-of-life. This kind of ongoing commitment to the open-source ecosystem is crucial, and we’re excited to see the benefits it brings to the developer community.” — said a spokesperson for the Express Technical Committee. 

Express NES is designed as a drop-in replacement for legacy versions of Express.js, offering security patches, compatibility updates and compliance fixes. This solution ensures that developers can remain on legacy Express.js without becoming vulnerable to security risks and compliance issues.

> “We’re thrilled to introduce Express NES as part of our continued mission to support the sustainability of key open-source tools
>
> Our partnership with OpenJS has enabled us to meet the needs of developers still relying on older versions of critical frameworks. Express NES ensures that they can continue building and maintaining their applications without the risk of security vulnerabilities or loss of compliance.” — Joe Eames, VP of Partnership at HeroDevs.
