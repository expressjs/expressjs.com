Welcome to the new Express blog!  The blog is meant to be a primary means of communication for the Express technical committee (TC).  While we currently have other channels such as X, LinkedIn, and of course GitHub, there's no authoritative "soapbox" for announcements and general communication.

Initially, the Express blog will be a venue:
- For periodic announcements of new releases, pre-releases, plans, and ongoing work on the project.
- For the Express TC to discuss issues of particular importance to the Express community.
- To highlight security issues or other urgent information.
 
Eventually, we hope the blog will evolve into a more general communication hub for the entire Express community; for example to share examples, tips, and experiences with the Express ecosystem and other information that's not simply technical documentation or GitHub discussion.

Initially, posts will be written by TC members (potentially collaborating others), mainly because we don't have bandwidth to review general posts from the broader community. Eventually, we would love to open up the blog for broader contributions, but for now the focus is on trying to release Express 5.0, and the reality of an open-source project is that everyone has finite time to contribute. 

Express TC member [Ulises Gasc√≥n](https://github.com/UlisesGascon) suggested a number of interesting topics for blog posts in [expressjs.com issue 1500](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com/issues/1500), but there are undoubtedly many others. 

If you have an idea for a post, feel free to pitch the idea! You can add a comment to [expressjs.com issue 1500](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com/issues/1500) or open a new issue, and then after appropriate discussion, open a PR.  We've also written up simple [instructions to create a blog post](/en/blog/write-post.html). 

Happy blogging!
