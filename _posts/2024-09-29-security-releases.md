## High severity vulnerability CVE-2024-45590 in body-parser middleware

**[body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) version `<1.20.3` is vulnerable to denial of service when URL-encoding is enabled**

A malicious actor using a specially-crafted payload could flood the server with a large number of requests, resulting in denial of service.

**Affected versions**: `<1.20.3`

**Patched versions**: `>=1.20.3`

This vulnerability was discovered during the [OSTIF audit to Express](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg/issues/6) and was mitigated by [the Express security triage team](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg?tab=readme-ov-file#security-triage-team).

## High severity vulnerability CVE-2024-47178 in basic-auth-connect middleware

**[basic-auth-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-auth-connect) uses a timing-unsafe equality comparison**

basic-auth-connect `<1.1.0` uses a timing-unsafe equality comparison that can leak timing information

**Affected versions**
- `<1.1.0`

**Patched versions**
- `>=1.1.0`

This vulnerability was discovered during the [OSTIF audit to Express](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg/issues/6) and was mitigated by [the Express Securty triage team](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg?tab=readme-ov-file#security-triage-team).

## Moderate severity vulnerability CVE-2024-45296 in path-to-regexp utility module

The **[path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) utility module is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack**.

A bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.

Using `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but in essence, the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match, but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.

Because JavaScript is single-threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment, using Express v4 and ten concurrent connections results in an average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.

**Affected versions**:
- `>=4.0.0`, `<8.0.0`
- `>=0.2.0`, `<1.9.0`
- `<0.1.10`
- `>=2.0.0`, `<3.3.0`
- `>=4.0.0`, `<6.3.0`

**Patched versions**:
- `>=8.0.0`
- `>=1.9.0`
- `>=0.1.10`
- `>=3.3.0`
- `>=6.3.0`
