  **Express 3.x IS END-OF-LIFE AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

  Known and unknown security and performance issues in 3.x have not been addressed since the last update (1 August, 2015). It is highly recommended to use the latest version of Express.

  If you are unable to upgrade past 3.x, please consider [Commercial Support Options](/{{ page.lang }}/support#commercial-support-options).
