# Serving static files in Express
Serving files, such as images, CSS, JavaScript and other static files is accomplished with the help of a built-in middleware in Express - `express.static`.

Pass the name of the directory, which is to be marked as the location of static assets, to the `express.static` middleware to start serving the files directly. For example, if you keep your images, CSS, and JavaScript files in a directory named `public`, you can do this:

~~~js
app.use(express.static('public'));
~~~

Now, you will be able to load the files under the `public` directory:

~~~js
http://localhost:3000/images/kitten.jpg
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/images/bg.png
http://localhost:3000/hello.html
~~~

<div class="doc-box doc-info">
The files are looked up relative to the static directory, therefore, the name of the static directory is not a part of the URL.
</div>

If you want to use multiple directories as static assets directories, you can call the `express.static` middleware multiple times:

~~~js
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.static('files'));
~~~

The files will be looked up in the order the static directories were set using the `express.static` middleware.

If you want to create a "virtual" (since the path does not actually exist in the file system) path prefix for the files served by `express.static`, you can [specify a mount path](/4x/api.html#app.use) for the static directory, as shown below:

~~~js
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
~~~

Now, you will be able to load the files under the `public` directory, from the path prefix "/static".

~~~js
http://localhost:3000/static/images/kitten.jpg
http://localhost:3000/static/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/static/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/static/images/bg.png
http://localhost:3000/static/hello.html
~~~

However, the path you provide to `express.static` is relative to the directory where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, it's safer to use the absolute path of the directory you want to serve:

~~~js
app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
~~~
