# Debugging Express

Express uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module
internally to log information about route matches, middleware in use, application mode,
and the flow of the request-response cycle.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
`debug` is like an augmented version of `console.log`. But unlike `console.log`, you don't have to
comment out `debug` logs in production code. It is turned off by default and can be conditionally turned on with the use an environment variable named `DEBUG`.
</div>

To see all the internal logs used in Express, simply set the `DEBUG` environment variable to
`express:*` when launching your app.

```sh
$ DEBUG=express:* node index.js
```

On Windows, use the corresponding command.

```sh
> set DEBUG=express:* & node index.js
```

Running this on the default app generated by the [express generator](/starter/generator.html) would print the following.

```sh
$ DEBUG=express:* node ./bin/www
  express:router:route new / +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +1ms
  express:router:route get / +1ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router:route new / +1ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router:route get / +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:application compile etag weak +1ms
  express:application compile query parser extended +0ms
  express:application compile trust proxy false +0ms
  express:application booting in development mode +1ms
  express:router use / query +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / expressInit +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / favicon +1ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / logger +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / jsonParser +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +1ms
  express:router use / urlencodedParser +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / cookieParser +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / stylus +90ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / serveStatic +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / router +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +1ms
  express:router use /users router +0ms
  express:router:layer new /users +0ms
  express:router use / <anonymous> +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / <anonymous> +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
  express:router use / <anonymous> +0ms
  express:router:layer new / +0ms
```

Now, when a request is made to the app, you will see the logs specified in the Express code.

```sh
  express:router dispatching GET / +4h
  express:router query  : / +2ms
  express:router expressInit  : / +0ms
  express:router favicon  : / +0ms
  express:router logger  : / +1ms
  express:router jsonParser  : / +0ms
  express:router urlencodedParser  : / +1ms
  express:router cookieParser  : / +0ms
  express:router stylus  : / +0ms
  express:router serveStatic  : / +2ms
  express:router router  : / +2ms
  express:router dispatching GET / +1ms
  express:view lookup "index.jade" +338ms
  express:view stat "/projects/example/views/index.jade" +0ms
  express:view render "/projects/example/views/index.jade" +1ms
```

To see the logs only from the router implementation set the value of `DEBUG` to `express:router`. Likewise, to see logs only from the application implementation set the value of `DEBUG` to `express:application`, and so on.

## `express`-generated app

The app generated by the `express` command also uses the `debug` module and its debug namespace is scoped to the name of the application.

If you generated the app with

```sh
$ express sample-app
```

You can enable the debug statements with the following command

```sh
$ DEBUG=sample-app node ./bin/www
```

You can specify more than one debug namespace by assignning a comma separated list of names, as shown below.

```sh
$ DEBUG=http,mail,express:* node index.js
```

For more documentation on `debug`, see the [debug guide](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug).
