# expressjs.com

This is the repository of the website [expressjs.com](http://expressjs.com). It is hosted directly from the repository as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

## Local Setup

To preview the website locally, install 
[Ruby and Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) if you don't have them already.

Install the [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) gem:
```
$ gem install jekyll-redirect-from
```

Once you installed these and cloned the repo, `cd` to the repository directory and run the following command:

```
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will look in the Gemfile for which gems to install. The `github-pages` gem includes the same version of Jekyll and other dependencies as used by GitHub Pages, so that your local setup mirrors GitHub Pages as closely as possible.

Run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) on your browser.

## Formatting

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

Jekyll uses the [Liquid template engine](http://liquidmarkup.org/) for templating.

You can use [http://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/gfm.html](GFM) fenced code blocks for JavaScript; for example:

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.listen(3000);
```
`
The default GitHub Pages syntax highlighting has been disabled in `_config.yml to allow highlighting with prism.js

## Contributing

Feel free to make changes to the template files or the document files. The supporting docs are located in their respective directories, and the API docs are located under the `_includes` directory.

## Why use Jekyll instead of an Express-based solution?

Jekyll comes built-in with GitHub Pages. Since we are already using GitHub Pages to host the website, it makes sense to leverage the capabilities it provides. It's all about using the right tool, for the right job, under the right circumstances.

## How do I help translate the docs to another language?

**IMPORTANT:** We have professional translations of the Express documentation into:
- German
- French
- Italian
- Spanish
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Japanese
- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese
- Russian
- Korean

Therefore we can no longer accept community translations for these languages.  However, we welcome contributions of translations into other languages, following the procedure below.

Follow these steps:

0. Clone the [Express repository](https://github.com/strongloop/expressjs.com)
1. Create a directory for the language of your choice using its [ISO 639-1 code](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) as its name.
2. Copy `index.md`, `api.md`, `starter/`, `guide/`, `advanced/`, `resources/`, `4x/`, and `3x/`, to the language directory.
3. Remove the link to 2.x docs from the "API Reference" menu.
4. Update the `lang` variable in the copied markdown files.
5. Update the `title` variable in the copied markdown files.
6. Create the header, footer, notice, and announcement file for the language in the `_includes/` directory, in the respective directories, and make necessary edits to the contents.
7. Create the announcement file for the language in the `_includes/` directory.
8. Create a copy of the `_includes/api/en` and rename it according to the language code.
9. Make sure to append `/{{ page.lang }}` to all the links within the site.
