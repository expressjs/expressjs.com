# Express behind proxies

Using Express behind a reverse proxy (such as Varnish or Nginx)
is trivial; however, it does require configuration. By enabling the 
"trust proxy" setting via `app.enable('trust proxy')`, Express 
will have knowledge that it's sitting behind a proxy and that the 
`X-Forwarded-*` header fields may be trusted. (Otherwise, 
they are easily spoofed.)

Enabling this setting has several subtle effects. The first is
that `X-Forwarded-Proto` may be set by the reverse proxy to
tell the app whether it is https or simply http. This value is reflected
by [req.protocol](/{{ page.lang }}/api.html#req.protocol).

The second change is that the [req.ip](/{{ page.lang }}/api.html#req.ip) 
and [req.ips](/{{ page.lang }}/api.html#req.ips) values will be populated with
`X-Forwarded-For`'s list of addresses.
